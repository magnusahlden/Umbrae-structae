# Umbrae structae

umbrae structuae is latin for "Structured ghosts"
its a desktop app to handle incoming jobs for a set of agents
through an inbox. 
then it will display a trello like interface where tasks can be moved fro left to right
moving the tasks from:
inbox
prioritized
suggested plan
accepted plans
to executing plan
to waiting for user input
to completed. 

a task can ping pong between "excuting plan" to "waiting for user input" as many times as neccesary
until the sugehstef plan has reched its goal state. 

a task can be moved from invox to prioritized only by a human or a human defined rule. 
 tadk in prioritized eill be looked at by a planning agent. the planning agent will suggest a plan on how to resolve the task. 
the plan is then presented in the "suggested plan" stage. 
here a user can choose to accept or reject thr plan. 
if the plan was rejected it will be moved back to the planning agent with some feedback pl how to bettwr come up with a plan. 

a plan is made up by buidling blocks that either 
- do an action
- query for data
- ask for user input eith boolean, or free text
- choose a path based on data or inpur

on top of the plan steps each plan also gets an permission slip which is a permit certificate to do something the user agrees to. such as execute dangerous plan steps, fetch external data etc



a plan can be considered a very simple programming language. 
actions are defined as java objects that take an unmutable taskobject as input and return an responseobject. 
actions are divided into different types:
- classifiers (classify the data input)
- summarizers (reduces data complexity)
- external data fetching (mcp calling)
- update database 
- query database

each action can either be safe or dangerous: actions that require end user approval.
